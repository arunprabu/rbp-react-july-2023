Debugging
----
  1. Compilation Error 
      * during the development

  2. Runtime Error
      * will explain error boundary later

Performance Tuning in React App
----
    1. Send and Receive only necessary props
    2. Never have inline styles in lists and keys
    3. Keep JSX tags minimal 
    4. Use Fragment whereever needed

CSS Framework 
---
    Choices 
    ---
        * bootstrap or react-bootstrap or reactstrap 
        * @mui/material  (material ui)
        * antd
        * polaris or corbon or fluent2 design systems

Software design principle
---
    * DRY / WET 
    * KISS 

To learn:
Naming Conventions & Casing Conventions 
----
Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 
        * all react components should be named in PascalCase
        * all components folder should be of this type 

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html or JSX elements 

        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names (if not react), assets in front end projects 
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect says okay

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples

ReactJS - Performace Tips
--
1. Use NPM package or any third party libraries only if absolutely needed.
2. Most performance issues come in lists. So, think about having pagination.
  Try this awesome package
  https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/
3. Make use of props wisely. Don't leave out unused props. 
  
  So, a bad way could be...
  const MyComp = (props) => { //bad way if all props are not used

  }

  but a better way to have props is here.. using object destructuring.
  cont MyComp = ({ title, body, postId}){ // ignoring userId, if I don't display it anywhere

  }
  Also,don't pass unneccessary props. 
  And wise idea is not to store userId in the redux store.

4. Lazy Load Images 
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazy-load-image-component
5. Use profiler to record the app pages. And then check and fix the app. 
6. Use Redux Dev Tools to check how long it take for the actions.
7. Think about optimizing back end also. 
8. Avoid having unnecessary tags, css. go with Fragment, <></>, 
9. Don't bloat the page with too many components, 
  because will have lifecycle hooks and will have re-rendering cycles.
  If one parent comp updates, that will update child comp's till the last level.
  Solution could be to use Pure Components 
10. Don't have more class components. Use functional components. 
  Use hooks to stop child comp re-rendering. Remember useEffect, useCallback!
11. Don't write too many inline styles. You should definitely avoid it inside loops.
12. Don't write inline callbacks in loops. 
    // bad 
    <button onClick={() => deleteRecord()} >Delete</button> 
    // good 
    const deleteRecord = () =>{

    }
    <button onClick={deleteRecord} >Delete</button> 

13. Use Why did you update tool
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@welldone-software/why-did-you-render
14. shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle hook
15. Avoid prop drilling
16. Learn more performance tips.. There are aplenty.

Project: calc
--------------
  Sources: FRD, Designs, HLD, LLD

  Development 
  --- 
    Feature: add 

    Test cases  / test specs / tests 
    ---
      1. inputs should be numbers 
      2. output should be number 
      3. if wrong in inputs entered add button should be disabled 

    code:
    --- 
      function add(a, b){
        if(typeof a === number & typeof b === number){
          return a + b;
        } 
      }

      add(10, 20); // 30

    [Tools are doing the TESTING]


Modern s/w dev approach
---
  Dev writing test cases => Dev writing functionality => (Tools) => (SUCCESS / FAILURE)


Automated Testing 
---
  * Writing code to test our project code 

  0. Static Type Checking
      Tools: TypeScript, FlowJS or Prop-Types

  1. Unit Testing [TO LEARN]
      * Testing tiny, independent block of code in a comp 
      * Testing the comp isolation. (w/o connecting to the REST API)
      * Bug reduction density: 40-80%
      Tools: JEST, React Testing Library 

      JEST - is an unit testing framework and also a test runner 
      React Testing Library(RTL) - DOM querying utility

  2. Integration Testing 
      Tools: JEST, React Testing Library or EnzymeJS

  3. End to End Testing
      Tools: Selenium, Playwright, CypressJS, Protractor

=====

Modern Software Development Approaches 
  1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) [TO LEARN]
      * writing fn code only if test fails 

      Dev writing test cases => (FAILS) => Dev writing fn code => (SUCCESS) => [CODE COMPLETE]

      Test Pattern: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)
      Tools: JEST, React Testing Library

  2. Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)
      * writing fn code only if test fails 
      * Developing the app based on the behaviour the end user wants to experience in the app. 

      Dev writing test cases => (FAILS) => Dev writing fn code => (SUCCESS) => [CODE COMPLETE]

      Test Pattern: Given/When/Then 
      Tools: JasmineJS, Karma

React Patterns 
---
  1. The higher-order component pattern (hoc)
  2. Render props component pattern 
  3. State reducer pattern
  4. The provider pattern (useContext hook)
  5. The presentational and container component patterns
  6. The Hooks pattern (offers core react features state, lifecyle hook alternative)

-------------

Factory Pattern to group components
---
function ProductSidebarFactory({ productType, ...props }) {
  switch (productType) {
    case "clothing":
      return <ClothingProductSidebar {...props} />;
    case "electronics":
      return <ElectronicsProductSidebar {...props} />;
    case "homeGoods":
      return <HomeGoodsProductSidebar {...props} />;
    default:
      throw new Error(`Invalid product type: ${productType}`);
  }
}

<ProductSidebarFactory productType="clothing" />

PWA 
---
  mobile apps installable
  webapps are accessible over browser (mobile and desktop)

  installable webapps in both computer and mobile?
    PWA 

====


Cross comp commn-
  1. p to c 
  2. c to p 
  3. any to any comp commn 
      1. using React Context API (useContext)
      2. using Redux / zustand/ MobX / Flux / Recoil / jotai / 


State Management in Redux 
----
  1. React JS + React-Redux + Redux JS (classic redux from 2016) 
      * very complex 
      * steps (36-45)
      * additional tools
        1. redux-thunk / redux-saga 
        2. redux dev tools 
        3. immerjs 

  2. React + Redux-Toolkit (modern redux from 2020)
      * easier 
      * steps (4-8)
      * additional tools are already integrated
